# ðŸ§  Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic Control (Programs)

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** with Python implementations of the major topics from the **PE-EC702C: Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic Control** syllabus.  
It is designed as a **lab manual + learning guide** for students to bridge theory with practice using code, visualizations, and real-world examples.
